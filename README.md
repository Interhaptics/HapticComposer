The Haptic Composer allows developers to create haptic material using three different perceptions:

1. Vibrations-> best used for Android & iOS smartphones, Meta Quest Controllers & PlayStation 5 wideband haptics.
2. Textures -> best used for iOS Smartphones and PlayStation 5 Controllers.
3. Stiffness -> best used for PlayStation 5 Adaptive Triggers.

The haptic effects created with the Haptic Composer will be automatically imported by the Unity project and will be rendered by Interhaptics Unity SDK.
